(b) Description:
	-> The game is a simplistic version of the Pontoon game. The objective of the game is 
	   to keep the total score below 22 and force the other player to go over it by 
	   out-smarting them. 
	   
	 -> When you launch the game, you will see that the tiles do not initially have a number
	    and all the tiles are disabled. So to start the game, click on New Game button and 
	    dive right in!
	    
	 -> Also note that each tile can be used by only 1 player only and once it is clicked by a 
	    player, then the other player is not able to use the same tile again to make their move.
	    
	 -> Once either of the players wins the game, the game stops and the winner is announced
	    and the buttons are disabled to prevent any further interaction. To play another round, 
	    click on the New Game button again and then dive right into it!
	    
	 -> The game can be reset at any point while playing by click on New Game button or by clicking
	 	the New Game option from the File Menu.
	 
	 -> To exit the game, simply close the application by click the "X" or by click the exit option
	    from the File Menu.
